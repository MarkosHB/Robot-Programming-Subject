# Robot-Programming-Subject
Do u like &lt;3 robots as much as me? Don't think so...
- Have a look at [P1-Robotic_Arm](./P1-Robotic_Arm) to learn more about how to program Robotic Arms using Matlab and Scorbot. You should read first the  assigmment documentation at [Practica1.pdf](./P1-Robotic_Arm/Practica1.pdf) (project and code made fully by me).
- Check out this cool Microbots Practice at [P2-OpenLoop_ClosedLoop](./P2-OpenLoop_ClosedLoop) and its documtation [Practice2](./P2-OpenLoop_ClosedLoop/Practice2) (made alogn side my partner Aquiles).
