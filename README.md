# Robot-Programming-Subject
Do u like &lt;3 robots as much as me? Don't think so...
- Have a look at [P1-Robotic_Arm](./P1-Robotic_Arm) to learn more about how to program Robotic Arms using Matlab and Scorbot. You should read first the  assigmment documentation at [Practica1.pdf](./P1-Robotic_Arm/Practica1.pdf) (project and code made fully by me).
- Check out this cool Microbots Practice at [P2-OpenLoop_ClosedLoop](./P2-OpenLoop_ClosedLoop) and its documtation [Practica2.pdf](./P2-OpenLoop_ClosedLoop/Practica2.pdf) (made alognside my partner Aquiles).
- Second part of the Microbots Lessons. Find the project at [P3-PID_Controller](./P3-PID_Controller) and it's documentation [Practica3.pdf](./P3-PID_Controller/Practica3.pdf) (made alognside my partner Aquiles).
- In [P4-ROS](./P4-ROS) you will find a implementation of a node in ROS, the robotic operating system. More info in [Practica4.pdf](./P4-ROS/Practica4.pdf) (project and code made fully by me).
- Finally, in [PExtra-BookReview](./PExtra-BookReview) there is a presentation of the Chapter13 of the 'Robot Ethics.The ethical and social implications of Robotics' book. Check the slides here [Chapter13Slides.pdf](./PExtra-BookReview/Chapter13Slides.pdf)
